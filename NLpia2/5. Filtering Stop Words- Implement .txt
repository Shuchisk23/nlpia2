5. Filtering Stop Words- Implement a python program to filtering stopwords.

import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')

text = "NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]

print("Original Text:")
print(text)
print("\nFiltered Text (without stopwords):")
print(" ".join(filtered_tokens))


-----------------
Output:
Original Text:
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

Filtered Text (without stopwords):
NLTK leading platform building Python programs work human language data .
